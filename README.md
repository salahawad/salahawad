## A geek software developer with eagerness to experience the full chain process from product development to product design & management, to product marketing in both startups & multinational companies, well this summarizes it all.

I have an overall 15 years of experience in software development, 5 years of experience in technical and functional product management in a multinational company and 2 years of experience in business development, project management, and marketing.

I took over the Accelerator CTO position at Berytech in November 2019, and working closely for now with startups in Agrytech & Clean Energy fields, and preparing for new batches in SocialTech & Fintech industries as well.

I was recently assigned as deputy programs director at Berytech, in addition to my CTO role, to manage ACT SMART program fully funded by the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The main lesson learned from all those years was my attaint belief that the main key to success is my ability to keep learning on a daily basis to cope with market change and fast pace technologies.

And what is more, fun than to share all this knowledge with young talents seeking a bright professional future? Well Facebook gave me the needed platform through Facebook Developers Circle , a community I am currently leading in Beirut, that has more than 3200 developers for whom we organize regular monthly events and bring the best experts in new technologies to give them an overview on the current market business needs and of course while providing plenty of hands-on sessions and participating in local and international hackathons!
